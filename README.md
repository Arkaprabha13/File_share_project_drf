# File Sharing Platform with Django REST Framework (DRF)

![File Sharing Platform](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=File+Sharing+Platform)

A simple and intuitive file-sharing platform built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. This project allows users to upload multiple files, generate shareable links, and download files securely. The frontend is designed with **Bootstrap** and **FilePond**, providing a modern and responsive user interface.

Uploaded files are stored locally on the server's filesystem in the `media/` directory. No database is used for storing file metadata; instead, file paths and unique identifiers are managed in memory or through lightweight configurations.
